/****** Shop Class ******
* This class allows us to create shops with inventory in them. It can also automatically handle when items are added to
* the available inventory, sales on items, limits on how many items are available.
* 
* This class has to interact with the MyShop:: class on the app that you're using it for. This includes:
*	* MyShop::purchase()				// when the item is purchased from the shop
*	* MyShop::replaceInventory()		// when an item need to be replaced
* 
****** TRIGGERS when using this class *******

	A lot of triggers are activated with the Shop class due to the customization required for each individualized shop.
	
	All triggers attempt to use methods in the `MyShop` class (in your /app/classes folder).

****** Examples of using this class ******


****** Methods Available ******
* Shop::createCart($uniID);
