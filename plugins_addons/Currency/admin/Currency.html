/****** Currency Class ******
* This class allows users to acquire, lose, or exchange currency. Currency is a representation of the primary unit of
* virtual money on the system (such as gold, gems, auro, etc).
*
* Currency has it's own version of record keeping, not to be confused with the "Transaction" class or the "Credit"
* class, which handle different types of exchanges. These records are used for recording what you've purchased, sold,
* exchanged, received, or otherwise dealt with specifically for virtual currency.
* 
****** Example of using the class ******

// Add some money to the account
$balance = Currency::add(Me::$id, 10.50, "Logged in three days consecutively.");
var_dump($balance);

// Make a Purchase
$balance = Currency::subtract(Me::$id, 3.15, "Purchased Blue Beanie.");
var_dump($balance);

// Get the current balance
$balance = Currency::check(Me::$id);
var_dump($balance);

// Exchange currency with another user
$bobID = 4;
list($fromBalance, $toBalance) = Currency::exchange(Me::$id, $bobID, 2.50, "I send Bob 2.50 coins.", $errorStr);

if($errorStr) { echo "Error: " . $errorStr; } else { var_dump($fromBalance); var_dump($toBalance); }

****** Methods Available ******
* $balance = Currency::check($uniID)								// Returns the user's current balance
* 
* $balance = Currency::add($uniID, $amount, $desc, $errorStr)		// Adds $amount to user (from system)
* $balance = Currency::subtract($uniID, $amount, $desc, $errorStr)	// Subtracts $amount from $user (from system)
* 
* // Exchange money between two people
* list($fromBalance, $toBalance)= Credits::exchange($uniIDFrom, $uniIDTo, $amount, $desc, &$errorStr)
* 
* Currency::record($uniID, $uniIDOther, $amount, $balance, [$desc]);		// Record sending of transaction
