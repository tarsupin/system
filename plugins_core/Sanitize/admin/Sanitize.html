/****** About the Sanitize Class ******

User input can never be trusted. The best way to ensure that user input is safe is to use a whitelisting technique so
that all user input can only have specific characters that you've deemed acceptable. Though this doesn't protect
against every type of vulnerability, it will help ward off many security vulnerabilities.

If any of these Sanitize methods catch a value that doesn't belong, it will check if your application is running a
class called "AppSecurity" and attempt to alert it about the unsanitized data that is being used. It will provide a
suspicion / threat level of the attack, allowing you to filter out anything you deem low priority. In addition to the
attempt, it will inform you of the user that was making the attempt, the IP, and other details.

------ How the class works ------

The Sanitization methods each take a variable that you provide it and cleanse it of any characters that were not
explicitly allowed to be used.

For example, you can set your variables to:

	$value = Sanitize::word($value);			// only use letters
	$value = Sanitize::punctuation($value);		// only use letters, numbers, and certain punctuation

These methods also include a parameter called $extraChars. The $extraChars parameter allows you to add additional
characters to pre-defined whitelists. For example:

	$value = Sanitize::word($value, "123");			// only use letters and the numbers 1, 2, and 3
	$value = Sanitize::punctuation($value, "{}");	// use punctuation and these brackets: {  }

------------------------------------------
------ Examples of using this class ------
------------------------------------------

// User goes to the URL: page.php?myInput=YES;*!_123.01

echo $_GET['myInput'];									// Returns "YES;*!_123.01"

echo Sanitize::word($_GET['myInput']);					// Returns "YES"
echo Sanitize::word($_GET['myInput'], "123");			// Returns "YES12301"
echo Sanitize::whitelist($_GET['myInput'], "_.123");	// Returns "_123.1"
echo Sanitize::whitelist($_GET['myInput'], "ABCDE");	// Returns "E"

------ Application Plugins: AppSecurity ------
----------------------------------------------
	
	// When illegal user input is detected, it will attempt to call this plugin:
	AppSecurity::illegalInput($warningSeverity, $warningType, $illegalData, $illegalChars, $uniID, $remoteIP);
	
	// You can create this custom static class "AppSecurity.php" to your /{application}/classes directory
	// Give it the method ::illegalInput() with the parameters provided.

		$warningSeverity		// Rates threats 0 to 10. 0 is unlikely, 10 is guaranteed attack.
		$warningType			// Explains the type of warning, e.g. "Parent Path Injection"
		$illegalData			// The input that was sent to the system
		$illegalChars			// The illegal characters that were caught
		$uniID					// The UniID of the person who made the attempt (if logged in)
		$remoteIP				// The IP address of the target
