/****** About the UniFaction Class ******

This class works the magic that allows your site to login through UniFaction and return the appropriate user data to
your site's "/login" page if it was successful.

Once a user is logged into your site, you'll be able to access many of UniFaction's features and APIs.

-------------------------------
------ Methods Available ------

$loginResponse = UniFaction::login(SITE_URL . "/login", [$logMode], [$logAct]);	// Get response from UniFaction

UniFaction::siteLink($site1, $site2);	// Links two sites together with shared keys
